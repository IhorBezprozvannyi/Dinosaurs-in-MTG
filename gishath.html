            <h1>Deck-Building Strategy:</h1>
            <p>
                Gishath is a very straight-forward WinCondition-type commander, which just needs to hit one of your opponents to bring a couple of big Dinos onto the battlefield.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main things we are building a typical Gishath deck around are... Additional Combat Steps!
            </p>
            <h2>Ramp and Roll!</h2>
            <p>
                Well, before we get to our actual Extra-Combat business, we have to set ourselves up a bit with Ramp spells. 
                Gishath's mana-cost is 8, which is a lot, to say the least.
                That is exactly why we want around 15-20 ramp spells in our deck to get our commander going as early as turn 5 consistantly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most efficient ramp spells for this deck will include: 
                <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/163/entish-restoration">Entish Restoration</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/321/skyshroud-claim">Skyshroud Claim</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mic/144/somberwald-sage">Somberwald Sage</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Top-Deck Jump-Sacres!</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to having our ramp set up, we need some actual dinosaurs on top of our deck... 
                To achieve a more consistant outcome of this gmable - we need just a couple of top-deck manipulation spells!
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/337/scroll-rack">Scroll Rack</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rav/198/congregation-at-dawn">Congregation at Dawn</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/185/worldly-tutor">Worldly Tutor</a>, 
                are going to be great for that purpose.
            </p>
            <h2>Overrun 'em All!</h2>
            <p>
                Our commander works from dealing combat damage to our opponents, so we are going to abuse this to the best of our abilities, having an extra combat steps spells in our deck.
                It is going to be our win-condition for this particullar deck, so cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/252/savage-beating">Savage Beating</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/roe/172/world-at-war">World at War</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/uma/147/seize-the-day">Seize the Day</a>
                are going to be an amazing addition to our deck!
            </p>
            <p>
                Second option for us is to just simply play a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/289/finale-of-devastation">Finale of Devastation</a> once we have a ton of mana to sink into it!
                find some large dino onto the board and give every other creature at least +10/+10 is goint to be more than enough to win!
            </p>
