        </div>
        <div class="DescriptionDiv">
            <h1>Deck-Building Strategy:</h1>
            <p>
                Pantlaza is a very efficient engine-type commander that accumulates value over time, becoming stronger as you play stronger dinosaurs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The main mechanic that we are looking at in the typical Pantlaza deck is... Discover!
            </p>
            <h2>Discover Your True Power!</h2>
            <p>
                "Discover X" is a triggered ability that reads - 
                "Exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card with mana value X or less. 
                Cast it without paying its mana cost or put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom in a random order." 
            </p>
            <p>
                This ability is very similar to "Cascade", which is an older version of "Discover". To "Cascade" is to - When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card whose mana value is less than this spell's mana value. 
                You may cast that card without paying its mana cost if the resulting spell's mana value is less than this spell's mana value. 
                Then put all cards exiled this way that weren't cast on the bottom of your library in a random order.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discover is, needless to say, very powerful as it is basically a free spell or just a card in your hand! 
                That is why we are here to abuse our commander's ability to the fullest with cards, which are shown down the "Top-Synergy" section!
            </p>
            <h2>Win Conditions!</h2>
            <p>
                After we gain enough value from our commander, we want to finish the game as quickly as possible. To achieve that, we have two great options (very similar ones, truly):
                First option is to just play <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/172/last-march-of-the-ents">Last March of Ents</a>, while having a decent sized creature on the battlefield and overrun our opponents by putting tons of Dinos into play,
                including <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/237/palanis-hatcher">Palani's Hatcher</a> or <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/286/regisaur-alpha">Regisaur Alpha</a> to give them all Haste!
            </p>
            <p>
                Second option for us is to have a combo of two cards - <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/185/ghalta-stampede-tyrant">Ghalta, Stampede Tyrant</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afc/160/greater-good">Greater Good</a>.
                This way, you can do the same thing as if you had Last March of Ents, but, potentially, drawing more cards and therefore putting more creatures!
            </p>
