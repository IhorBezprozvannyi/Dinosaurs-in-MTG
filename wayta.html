        <h1>Wayta, Trainer Prodigy</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="DescriptionDiv">
        <h1>Deck-Building Strategy:</h1>
        <p>
            Wayta is a dinosaur commander which was demanded by many, ever since the first Ixalan and it is very strong and has a ton of potential.
            <br>
            That's because the main focus of Wayta decks is... Enrage!
        </p>
        <h2>No Pain No Gain, Baby!</h2>
        <p>
            As we can see, Wayta's activated ability is very flexible, because it gives us an option to either fight our own creature or fight our opponent's.
            However, we will probably utilise this ability to trigger our own dinos with "Enrage" mechanic.
            <br>
            What is "Enrage", anyway? Well, "Enrage" is a triggered ability which reads "Whenever X is dealt damage do Y". 
            Having this in mind, we are going to gladly abuse this with help of both abilities of Wayta. 
            Just activate her to fight our creatures and double the Enrage! As simple as that. 
            <br>
            The best Enrage dinos are: 
            <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/253/ripjaw-raptor">Ripjaw Raptor</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rix/123/cacophodon">Cacophodon</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/249/ranging-raptors">Ranging Raptors</a> just to mane a few.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflect the Damage!</h2>
        <p>
            Having fun with some of the value "Enrage" triggers is certainly fun, but we need to win the game somehow, aren't we?
            Well, for that purpose we are playing cards that reflect damage dealt to our creatures directly to our opponents!
            <br>
            For example, cards like 
            <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lcc/88/wrathful-raptors">Wrathful Raptors</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/161/brash-taunter">Brash Taunter</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/875/stuffy-doll">Stuffy Dol</a> are going to get the job done beautifuly!
        </p>
        <h2>Everything You Love Dies. (at least your opps are dead!)</h2>
        <p>
            Having all these damage-reflection pieces is great, now, we just need to deal damage to them. 
            That's exacly why we are plying damage-based borad-wipes in our deck!
            <br>
            Best cards to use are: <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/160/blasphemous-act">Blasphemous Act</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/165/waltz-of-rage">Waltz of Rage</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/259/star-of-extinction">Star of Extinction</a>.
